title: How to do what you know you should do
---

how to convince your procrastination monkey or subconcious or whatever to help you do what you want to do.


brute force
- Beat him into submission
- Idk what this looks like, seems the most painful
Ignore him
- Quickly plug your ears when he complains
Fool him
- Say "Just 2 more reps" and then do 5 more
- He will not trust you. Next time you ask him, he will say "fuck off"


appael to his laziness
- make things easy
train him
- use rewards to make it associate your action with pleasure
Scare him
- create a panic monster


️⭐ Get him on your side


align the incetives of the subconsious and concious mind


The procrastination monkey works to fulfill an identity, change that identity so that you and the monkey have the same incentives


you should try to use the ones in the second and third categories. Also, each time you do an action, it will reinforce it as part of your identity - something you _do_


what you do at any given moment is something ilke


$$ (identity \; alignment \times anticipated \; pleasure) - difficulty  + effort $$
