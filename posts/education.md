title: A new Education framework
---

Assumptions
1. A purpose of humanity is to act effecitively in the world to improve lives and reduce suffering.
2. Education is a tool for society to teach it's children to do #1
3. Technological and progress means the world changes quickly, meaning that to continually act effectively you must continually learn.


We complain a lot about our modern education system. It was designed for the industrial revolution to create obediate workers.


Our society is currently undergoing a shift back to a more hunter-gatherer-like economy. The 'gig-economy' and 'creator-economy' are names for an economy where individuals aren't trained to be physical machines, but rather creative agents. 


They highest paid people in the modern economy are professional decision-makers. Using highly valuable skills with high leverage, a good decision can be millions of times, or even infinitely more effective than a bad one, 


The best factory line worker was perhaps 3 times as good as the worst. but the best artist is millions, billions of times better than his/her peers. Satoshi Nakamoto, perhaps the most productive programmer of the 21st century, created >1,000,000,000,000 in value when they he/she/they created Bitcoin. We are moving into a more meritocratic world where technology can amplify the effect of our creative outputs. So how do we teach kids to thrive in this new world?


it has been true for a long time now that the universities don't have a monopoly on knowledge. But kids still drop "150 grand on a fuckin' education you could have got for a dollar fifty in late charges at the public library" (good will hunting). why is that?


##### Community
You are the average of the 5 people you hang around most, and highly selective schools allow young people to be surrounded by talented, ambitious, intelligent kids. In my opinion, this is the main value proposition of a traditional ivy league university. -- the curriculum might be 50% better than normal, the professors might be 5 times better. But the company -- the general hum of energy the you get by being surrounded by impressive, ambitious individuals, is priceless.


this is interesting - universities have a network effect. each impressive student at a university adds value to the network, which makes good universities exponentially better than average ones. 


This isn't very egalitarian -- the most talented kids all end up in one place, helping each other become the best versions of themselves, while everyone else is locked out. No, it would be better to have a system where visibility is unidirectional, or at least slanted unidirectionally. such that lower-acheivers can still be inspired and encouraged bythe success of others, while not dragging the standards of the system down. 


one way to do this might be to place everyone in system to which they are most valuable - thankfully, that happens to coincide (in my experience) with the system that people most want to be in. In other words, people are often best at what they enjoy. 


another question is 'how much better is one student than the next?' if my premise that education institutions have values based on network effects, then we don't want to let people into a network if they would significantly reduce it's value. (the value of a stanford education would significantly go down if you let the intake be 50% random)


##### Reputation
An Ivy league education is a ticket to a high paying job because of

- better education
- entrace requirements

this reputation is based more on IQ of students than on the actual education


maybe the onlly thing worth trying to communitcate - and this would be relatively pessimistic - is IQ. No, I don't think so



 So what have we got so far? this what universities currently provide
 - access to a high value network of people.
	 - this value comes from **excluding most people**.
	 - value hierarchies come from discrimination

 - a structured curriculum taught by experts.
 - a scarse and therefore vaulable and reputable qualification

does this mean a reason that nz universities are not as impressive is because there's simply not a big enough population to exclude most people and create a high value network?


teaching things in high school makes kids hate them


## What a new Education system could provide
A common mistake of innovators is to try to recreate existing things with new technology, in reality, new tehcnologies' most important uses are almost always completely novel. New products solve the same human desire, but in a compltely new way that no-one but visionaries can see
- the orginal ipad ads portrayed the ipad replacing a cookbook, little did we know, it would do so much more than that
- instagram scratches the itch of social status broadcasting - in a way, a high status instagram profile is the modern equivalent of a fur coat. But no one saw that coming.
- the iphone was originally announced as "a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communicator.‚Äù
- the point is - we shouldn't try to port the education system over to the internet. we should find the **human problems** it currently solves and use our brand new technology to solve them again, better, from scratch.


### the unbundling and rebundling of the ivy league
so how do we do that
 - access to a high value network of people.
	 - the internet connects people like never before.
 - a structured curriculum taught by experts.
	 - the internet is the ultimate meritocracy of information
		 - why be taught calculus by someone from your small town when you can watch 3blue1brown or [that asian australian math guy] - widely considered some of the best math educators on the planet. we have not asked this question seriously enough: WHY ARE BAD TEACHERS STILL ALLOWED TO TEACH WHEN THERE ARE BETTER ONES ALL OVER THE INTERNET
	 - We need a to create new standards for our new age. the last 100 years saw a Harvard MBA or a MIT PHD as the supreme intelligence symbols.
		 - just as cryptopunks and bored apes are the status symbols of a new era, an open market of new scarse qualifications will give rise to new intelligence symbols.
		 - PREDICTION: the harvard mba of the 21st centrury will be a collection of NFT microqualifications awarded by the most skilled internet communicators - the teachers who rise to the top in an free market of teachers.
		 - **PROBLEM: How do we create [proof of education]**
 - a scarse and therefore vaulable and reputable qualification
A VISION FOR AN OPEN MARKET OF EDUCATION
- a platform where educators can provide provably scarce qualifications. 
	- qualifications reflect on the educator - therefore educators are incentivised to only award truly educated people
	- qualifications awarded by a trusted educator have worth and proof of education
	- qualifications are truly meritocratic, can be earned over the internet and.
	- educators are awarded a portion of student's salaries if a job is gained via their education - a la lambda school


### Dependencies for this vision
- open marketplace of qualifications and tasks - supply and demand
	- reliable and recognised qualifications 
		- signal scarcity and authenticity
		- signal respect / usefullness - A qualification needs to be respected to be useful
			- it's the burden of the provider to provide genuine signals


the point of primary school is to teach, signalling isn't so important


### Opensea x Linkedin
in the same way that ThirdWeb is creating smart-contracts as a service, and Opensea provides an NFT art framework as a service. A new company could offer a qualification/education NFT platform.

Maybe there could even be a new cert-NFT standard endorsed by other wallets?
