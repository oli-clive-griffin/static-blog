title: The grey zone
---

You must stay out of the grey zone.


The grey zone will kill you slowly it you let it.


The Grey zone is that mildly acidic, itchy area in between work and play. It's watching a movie while doing homework. it's listening to a podcast in the gym. It's figuring out your weekly budget as you lie down to sleep.


Every moment in your life can be plotted on the shaded continuum. at one end is meditation, walks in nature, sleep, showers, listening to music, reading ficton, watching a movie. On the other end is problem solving, public speaking, learning a complex topic. 


It's important to try not to mix the two ends. Replying to emails while watching a movie will destroy both your enjoyment of the movie and your speed in replying to emails. 1) Turn off the movie. 2) boost through the emails. 3) turn the movie back on and watch in piece.
