title: Thoughts on time
---

There's not much time really.


I view time as a spendable asset. Of course. we "spend time"


As with money, time can be spent in bad and good ways.


time invested now is more valuable than time invested in 10 years.


Every moment in the future can benefit or be harmed by my actions now. this only flows one way


The past is fiction.


It's important that in investing all this time now, I don't make myself miserable.


That's where it becomes really important to be doing something you can enjoy. 


however. A life only focussed on present pleasures is a miserable one.
